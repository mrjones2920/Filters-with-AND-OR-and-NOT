# Filters with AND,OR and NOT
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this lab, you’ll use the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. You’ll use SQL to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run SQL queries.

<h2>What you’ll do</h2>
You have multiple tasks in this lab:

 - Filter for login attempts that occurred after hours
 - Filter for login attempts on specific dates
 - Filter for login attempts from specific locations
 - Filter for information on employees in specific departments
 - Filter for information on employees not in a specific department

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this scenario, you need to obtain specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they belong to from the database.

Your team needs data to investigate potential security issues and to update computers.

You are responsible for filtering the required information from the database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve all failed login attempts after business hours. Second, you’ll retrieve all login attempts that occurred on specific dates. Third, you’ll retrieve logins that didn't originate in Mexico. Fourth, you’ll retrieve information about certain employees in the Marketing department. Fifth, you’ll retrieve information about employees in the Finance or the Sales department. Finally, you’ll obtain information about employees who are not in the Information Technology department.
